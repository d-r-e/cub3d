Raycasting engine as in Wolfenstein 3D, made from scratch at 42 Madrid.
Raycasting is a method to project a 3D illusion based on a 2D map and calculating the distance from player's position to every wall in their field of view.
It is highly efficient as it doesn't need an actual 3D engine to produce 3D images.
